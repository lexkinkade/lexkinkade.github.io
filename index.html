            <p>In 2017, Alexander (Lex) Kinkade graduated from Wright State University, where he majored in Electrical Engineering. He currently works for Honeywell as a Software Controls Engineer; where he programs conveyor and robots to automate industrial supply chain buildings for companies. During this time he has been honored with multiple internal awards by management and department executives for his contributions. He emphasizes how critical it is to "do it right the first time, or don't do it at all." Something that his father instilled in him early on in his life.  
            <br>
            <br>
            Born in Ogden, UT, he grew up with an engineering father from Illinois and a elementary school teaching mother from Central America. In 2005, his father and family was transferred to Ohio by the U.S. Air Force, which is where he has resided since. Early on, his father instilled critical thinking and problem solving; his mother instilled integrity and compassion for those less fortunate. His mother took the family abroad, he was able to travel to third-world countries at an early age. Opening his eyes opened to life outside of the United States.

            Influenced by the concept of a "polymath", Lex is a jack of all trades. During the day, he is usually found in the garage tearing apart the engine of his car, or working on his motorcycle for the next track day event. At night he can be found observing the night sky with his telescope he drafted and 3D printed. He is obsessed with building and learning new things. Currently, Lex is pursuing a Master of Science in Astronautical Engineering with a Thesis in Rocket Propulsion, at The Ohio State University. On top of this, his future endeavors include obtaining his Private Pilot's License, become a State licensed Motorcycle Safety Instructor, and get married to his sweatheart, Deborah Spies.

            <h1>METHODOLOGIES</h1>
            <p>
              My personal career objectives are to take initiative with all assigned projects, maintain my professional integrity, and hone in on precise results. As each day passes, I aim to be a better person than I was the day prior in work, and in life. I aim to maximize my leadership potential, communication and problem solving skills. I value punctuality and adaptability in work. It is important to be flexible to fast changing schedules in a dynamic and changing tech industry.  <br><br>
              My work mantra is to focus on delivering the best solution and product given the constraints instead of focusing on how to make the most amount of profit.
              “There should be more focus on the product or service itself, less time on board meetings, less time on financials. When I go spend time on the factory floor or really using the cars or thinking about the rockets...that’s where things have gone better.” <br>- Elon Musk, 2020

            <img src="images/sts.jpg" alt="NASA Astronaut EVA" style="max-width: 15%; height: auto;">
            <p>My dream job is to become an astronaut, and perform an EVA; repairing something in outerspace. It is a passion that comes from all of the things I grew up loving. The excitement of adventure, the science and problems of engineering, and the satisfaction of building something with your hands. I dream of the day where I can make all of this a reality; and, believe it is in my power to make it happen. One day humanity will see the earth as the Pale Blue Dot that Carl Sagan once described it as. </p>
